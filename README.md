## Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description

The coding quiz is a timed assessment that utilizes JavaScript basics to track high scores and provide feedback on users' performance. HTML is utilized for structuring and CSS is used for styling. The quiz comprises a start button, which initiates the countdown timer, and each wrong answer results in a reduction in the remaining time. Once all questions have been answered, or the timer runs out, the game ends and the user can save their initials and score.
